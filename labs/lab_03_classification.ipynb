    "Colorectal cancer is one of the most widespread cancers for men and women. Diagnosis complemented with prognostic and predictive biomarker information is essential for patient monitoring and applying personalized treatments. A critical marker is the tumor/stroma ratio in unhealthy tissues sampled from the colon. The higher the ratio, the more invasive the cancer is. The degree of invasion is tightly linked to patient survial probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the ratio, a pathologist needs to analyze the unhealthy tissue under a microscope and estimate it from a look. As the number of samples to analyze is huge and estimations are only sometimes precise, automatic recognition of the different tissue types in histological images has become essential. Such an automatic process requires the development of a multi-class classifier to identify the numerous tissues. As shown below, they are usually 8 tissue types to categorize: TUMOR, STROMA, LYMPHO (lymphocytes), MUCOSA, COMPLEX (complex stroma), DEBRIS, ADIPOSE and EMPTY (background).\n",

Moreover, the annotator must label every tissue type while only two (TUMOR and STROMA) are interesting. \n",
