    "Colorectal cancer is one of the most widespread cancers for men and women. Diagnosis complemented with prognostic and predictive biomarker information is essential for patient monitoring and applying personalized treatments. A critical marker is the tumor/stroma ratio in unhealthy tissues sampled from the colon. The higher the ratio, the more invasive the cancer is. The degree of invasion is tightly linked to patient survial probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the ratio, a pathologist needs to analyze the unhealthy tissue under a microscope and estimate it from a look. As the number of samples to analyze is huge and estimations are only sometimes precise, automatic recognition of the different tissue types in histological images has become essential. Such an automatic process requires the development of a multi-class classifier to identify the numerous tissues. As shown below, they are usually 8 tissue types to categorize: TUMOR, STROMA, LYMPHO (lymphocytes), MUCOSA, COMPLEX (complex stroma), DEBRIS, ADIPOSE and EMPTY (background).\n",

In histology, annotating data is difficult. It is time-consuming and requires the expertise of pathologists. Moreover, the annotator must label every tissue type while only two (TUMOR and STROMA) are interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we propose another approach. In order to make the annotation task less tedious, we ask the annotator to label only the tissues of interest and dump the others. Then, we must train a binary classifier to automatically recognize these tissues at test time. In this part, you will implement the proposed approach."

A large covariance leads to a smaller distance, which is intuitive because a large variance in the distribution makes it more likely for a point far away to be a part of the distribution. The minimum Mahalanobis distance takes the smallest distance to any distribution, and if this distance is larger than the threshold we know that the distance to any distribution is larger than our threshold. We can then discard this point as being a part of any distribution if it is above the threshold, saying it's OoD."
