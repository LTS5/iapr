### Objective of this course
Learn the basic methods of digital image analysis and pattern recognition:
pre-processing, image segmentation, shape representation and classification.
These concepts will be illustrated by applications in computer vision and
medical image analysis.

### Objective of this repository
This repository contains the material for the labs and project associated with
the [EPFL] master course
[EE-451 Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition][edu].

## Installation instructions

### Python and packages
We will be using [git], [Python], and packages from the
[Python scientific stack][scipy].
If you don't know how to install these on your platform, we recommend to
install [Anaconda] or [Miniconda], both are distributions of the [conda]
package and environment manager.
Please follow the below instructions to install it and create an environment
for the course:

1. Download the latest Python 3.x installer for Windows, macOS, or Linux from
   <https://www.anaconda.com/download> or <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>
   and install with default settings.
   Skip this step if you have conda already installed (from [Miniconda] or
   [Anaconda]).
   Linux users may prefer to use their package manager.
   * Windows: Double-click on the `.exe` file.
   * macOS: Double-click on the `.pkg` file.
   * Linux: Run `bash Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` in your terminal.
1. Open a terminal. For Windows: open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.
1. Install git if not already installed with `conda install git`.
1. Download this repository by running
   `git clone https://github.com/LTS5/iapr`.
1. It is recommended to create an environment dedicated to this course with
   `conda create -n iapr python=3.6`.
1. Activate the environment:
   * Linux/macOS: `source activate iapr`.
   * Windows: `activate iapr`.
1. Install the packages we will be using for this course:
   * Linux/macOS: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
   * Windows: `conda install --file requirements.txt`
1. You can deactivate the environment whenever you are done with `deactivate`

### Python editors

We suggest two different Python editors, but many more are available:

1. [Jupyter] is a very useful editor that run directly in a web browser.
   You can have Python and Markdown cells, hence it is very useful for
   examples, tutorials and labs.
   We encourage to use it for the lab assignments.
   To launch a Jupyter Notebook:
   * Open a terminal (for Windows open the Anaconda Prompt)
   * Move to the git repository `/path/to/iapr`
   * Activate the environment with `source activate iapr` (For Windows:
   `activate iapr`)
   * Run the command: `jupyter notebook`.
1. [PyCharm] is an excellent Python IDE developed by [JetBrains].
   It is more suitable for large projects than Jupyter, hence it might be
   useful for the final project.
   Multiple versions are [available][pycharm-dl]:
   * Free 'Community' version.
   * Professional version: free with the [education pack][jetbrains-student]
   (available for EPFL students).
